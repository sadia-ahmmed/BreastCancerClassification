# BreastCancerClassification

Classify Breast Cancer from  [UCI ML Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeandedieunyandwi/breast-cancer-dataset-uci-ml) using 4 models

## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit Learn
- Matplotlib

## Outcome
There are two expected outcomes: Malignant(1) and Benign(0).

### Models and Accuracy Scores

{'Ridge Classifier': 0.956140350877193,
 'SVC': 0.9736842105263158,
 'Decision Tree': 0.9122807017543859,
 'Random Forest': 0.9736842105263158}

**SVC and Random Forest perform the best and Decision Tree performs the worst!** 



## Conclusion
I randomly chose one of the test samples and predicted, using all four models by the **voting method**, if the person has breast cancer or not.
